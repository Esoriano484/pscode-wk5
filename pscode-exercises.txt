// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers
let num 1=4  
let num 2=8
let sum num1 + num2 = 12


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

let num 1 =4
let num 2 =8

if (num1 % 2 == 0)  num 1 is even 
or else  num1 is odd 
if (num2 % 2 ==0) num 2 is even 
or else num2  is odd 



// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

let num 1 = 4
let num 2 = 8
let num 3 = 6
let num 4 = 10
let num 5 = 15
let average = sum /5;
The minimun is 4
The meximum is 15
